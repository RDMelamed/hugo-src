Hello, my name is Jianfeng Ke. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UMass Lowell. I studied Math and Applied Math at Tsinghua University as an undergrad and I got my master degree at Boston University in Bioinformatics. I am interested in applying statistical or machine learning models on data to explain and also predict the occurrence of cancers and diseases. After completing my PhD, I would pursue a Postdoc position in a Comp-Bio lab and do health-related research. In my free time, I love to do some sports, especially badminton and soccer, or listen to music.
