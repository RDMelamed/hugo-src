I am a Yash Verma, a senior undergraduate Bioinformatics major at UMass Lowell. This is my first real research lab experience and I love how interesting and challenging it is. My plan is to work in more research labs, as a scribe, and as an EMT before applying to medical school in a couple of years. In my free time, I enjoy listening to informative podcasts about the stock market and politics.
