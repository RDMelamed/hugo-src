Hello, my name is Sarvenaz Ghaedi. I am a master's student in the biological science program(bioinformatics option). I have a background in cell and molecular biology with a particular interest in bioinformatics. I am very keen to combine my biological background with computational expertise to use for genomics and transcriptomics data analysis and to develop my research in terms of finding a connection between diseases.
My career goals are to do a Ph.D. and Postdoctoral training to obtain sufficient knowledge and experience as a scientist working in pharmaceutical and medical companies. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and spending time with my friends and family.
