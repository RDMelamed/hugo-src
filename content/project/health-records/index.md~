One way to discover influences on cancer development is by examining many peopleâ€™s health histories. Drugs taken for other purposes may impact pre-cancerous tissue, which can manifest in altered rates of cancer among treated individuals. We use medical records data and apply methods from epidemiology and causal inference in order to infer the effects of other diseases, common drugs, and combinations of these factors on cancer onset.
