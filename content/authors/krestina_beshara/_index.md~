I am David Hamel-Sellman, an undergraduate math major at UMass Lowell. I have concentrated my education towards computer science and biotech and I hope to gain data science work experience and/or pursue higher education once I graduate next year. I am a motivated Honors and Professional Co-Op student and I have enjoyed the opportunity to work in Dr. Rachel Melamed's Computational Biology Lab since February 2021. In my free time I love to be active whether it's hiking, biking, skiing, or playing club sports. During the school year, I compete in Division II collegiate rugby as a part of the UML Men's Rugby club.
