I’m a Public Health major and this is my first research lab and coding experience. I’m enjoying it and I learn something new everyday about science, programing, and even myself. After graduation I plan on either going to medical school or getting my masters and doctoral degree in epidemiology. For fun I’m either at the gym picking up heavy things and putting them back down or singing and listening to music.
