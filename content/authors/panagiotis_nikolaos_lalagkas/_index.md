Hello! My name is Panagiotis Nikolaos Lalagkas, but you can call me Panos. I am a PhD student in Biology at UMass Lowell and I have background in Pharmacy and in Pharmacoepidemiology. I am excited about research and its impact on patientsâ€™ life. For this reason, I have committed myself to the world of scientific research focusing in bridging the gap between data generation and analysis for the improvement of patient outcome. In order to achieve this, I enjoy conducting translational research on the crossroads of Bioinformatics, Data Science and Epidemiology.
After completing my PhD, I could picture myself pursuing Postdoc research in Cancer Genomics. Eventually, my ambition is to become an expert bioinformatician in the field of Cancer Research, preferably in the academic environment.
In my sparse time, I enjoy going out with friends, making excursions, working out and playing basketball.
