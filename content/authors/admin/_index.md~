I am starting as an assistant professor at UMass Lowell in the Biology department in Fall 2020. I'm excited to work with Biology students at all levels to make discoveries about the origins of cancer.

My goal is to discover health conditions, medical treatments, or other exposures that change risk of cancer, by linking health data to molecular data. These results can uncover how the disease works and identify interventions to prevent and treat cancer.

To tackle this goal, our research will bring together many kinds of data, including health records, biobanks, cancer genomics projects, and massive experimental studies of drugs. We will use methods inspired by computer science and epidiemiology.
