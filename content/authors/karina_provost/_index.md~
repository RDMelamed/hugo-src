I'm a Computer Science major doing a minor in Biomedical Engineering and Technology. I am putting my efforts into learning about data science and hopefully AI and Machine Learning and how they can interact with the field of biology despite being new to all of this. I am happy to have joined Dr. Rachel Melamed's lab at the beginning of summer 2021. I hope to go to grad school for a masters in Computer Science. My hobbies include computers, video games, anime, trading cards, and poetry.
