title: The natural history of cancer
summary: We will use large health records data to learn how drugs, diseases, and other types of expsosures could change risk of cancer or change cancer outcome. These studies will complement our other work that uses genomic data to understand these effects.

One way to discover influences on cancer development is by examining many peopleâ€™s health histories. Drugs taken for other purposes may impact pre-cancerous tissue, which can manifest in altered rates of cancer among treated individuals. Famous examples include [metformin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804910004879), a diabetes drug which may reduce risk of cancer and is under investigation as a cancer therapy, and [combination hormone replacement therapy](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31709-X/fulltext), which was found to increase risk of breast cancer.

Similarly, some health conditions such as [high BMI](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)60892-8/fulltext) can increase risk of cancer, while others may decrease risk or result in better outcomes for cancer patients.

We use medical records data and apply methods from epidemiology and causal inference in order to infer the effects of other diseases, common drugs, and combinations of these factors on cancer onset and outcomes.
