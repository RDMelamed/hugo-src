I'm Aylinh Eng, and I'm a senior with a biology major and a psychology minor. Prior to working in the lab, I had research experience studying the narratives of child sexual abuse and financial literacy of individuals with autism. I'm also conducting research on the impact of COVID-19 as part of my honors thesis. I hope to attend graduate or medical school in the future. In my spare time, I volunteer at a local rape crisis center and hospice organization. In addition to that, I enjoy doing Sudoku and watching We Bare Bears.
