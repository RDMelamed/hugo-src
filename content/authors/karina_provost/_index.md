I am Karina Provost, and I am a Mathematics major with a Psychology minor. I am interested in statistics and data science. While I am not sure what career I will end up with, I know I want to help people. I am excited to do that with this lab. In my free time I like to listen to podcasts, go for walks, watch the Red Sox, and babysit.
