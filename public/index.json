We evaluate these embeddings using external data on drug indications. Then, we use the embeddings as a substitute for medical history to match patients, and develop evaluation metrics for these matches.\nWe demonstrate that these embeddings recover therapeutic uses of drugs. We use embeddings as an informative representation of relationships between drugs, between health history events and drug prescriptions, and between patients at a particular time in their health history. We show that using embeddings to match cohorts improves the balance of the cohorts in terms of poorly measured risk factors like smoking.\nUnike other embeddings inspired by word2vec, indication embeddings are specifically designed to capture the medical history leading to prescription of a new drug.
