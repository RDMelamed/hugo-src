![cancer development](img/research/cdev.png)
Cancer is essentially a human tissue that has gone rogue, weaponized and retrofitted to ensure its own survival in a hostile environment--the human body. The work of this lab is inspired by certain key aspects of this process:


- Cells are constantly at risk of DNA damage, which accumulate over divisions, figure, right **(A)**. But this damage only results in cancer when **driver mutations** affect certain well-defined [hallmark biological processes](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)00127-9). For example, in many melanomas a mutation to the gene *BRAF* triggers cell growth.

- But, the growth that can be caused by this one mutation is limited--the same *BRAF* mutation causes benign moles **(B)**. Instead, yet more damage is required to other key cellular processes **(C)** for cancer to develop. Cancers occur more with age, a result of the process of trial and error as cancers evolve a combination these abilities.

- Although the classic influence on cancer is acquired mutations,  other infuences on cancer development may alter some of the same biological processes. This can suggest new ways to understand the disease (figure, below).

  - Some people are born with very high genetic risk, **(D)** , such as people with the inherited BRCA mutation. But, other less rare genetic variation can influence cancer risk more subtly.

  - Other health conditions can change risk of cancer, **(E)**. For example, obesity has been shown to increase risk of cancer, possibly by effects on inflammation, hormones, or levels of insulin. 

  - Certain drugs used for other diseases have been discovered to have a secondary affect on cancer **(F)**. Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug, and it has been shown to reduce risk of cancer. Certain other drugs increase risk of cancer.
