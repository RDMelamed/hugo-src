I take my responsibilities as a mentor seriously, with a goal of treating students as colleagues in a collaboration. As an example of my mentoring philosophy, please check out the [Statement of Expectations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TYMqnLWHbvmojXoPGHoNd81ptF3fM_fm/view?usp=sharing) I created for summer research students previously.

**My responsibilities** involve:
- helping to set the scientific direction for the project
- providing the needed materials
- giving students regular feedback on results and reports

**The student's responsibilities** include:
- taking ownership of their project, meaning that they don't look at the project as something they are doing for me, but as something we are working on together
- learning to manage their time and organize their work
- communicating regularly, and making sure I am giving them feedback and anything else they need

I think it is important to address a common source of tension in research: the idea that only some people can "cut it". I do not feel it is my job as a mentor to judge students' brilliance, but only to work together on well-supported analyses using good communication. Research is hard, so project success should not be considered a reflection of your personal abilities. Please read up on [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), something that all of us in science are prone to suffer! This problem is often more acute for people in underrepresented groups (especially including women in science and ethnic minority members).
