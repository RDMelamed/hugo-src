Students who want to work in cancer research, and who are interested in learning and applying data science methods should contact me to join the lab. Our work is 100% computational, using data sets generated by other people. So, students should be excited to learn to visualize and model data sets using tools like R and Python, and packages like tensorflow/pytorch and Stan.

This research sits at the crossroads of computational biology, data science, and epidemiology, and there are a number of possible [projects](/#projects). Your ideas for other projects are welcome!

Please [write to me](/#contact) sending:
- your resume
- an unofficial transcript (or, relevant course background can be summarized in the resume)
- **Mandatory**: a cover letter describing why you are interested in the lab, how your background is related to this research, and what kind of projects you would like to work on. I do not guarantee a response to applications that do not include a customized cover letter, but I promise to respond to all applications including a customized cover letter. [This page](https://www.findaphd.com/advice/finding/academic-cover-letters.aspx) does a good job describing this type of cover letter.

**PhD Students**: These positions are fully funded with a mix of TAship and research funds. Students should apply to the [UML Applied Biology PhD program](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/biology/programs-of-study/phd-applied-biology.aspx) -- applications are rolling. Please note the requirements above before applying. Applications must include a cover letter describing the interest in this particular position.

**MS Students**: students should apply to the [MS Biology program](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/biology/programs-of-study/masters.aspx). As the MS program is only 2 years, students are encouraged to contact me as early as possible in your first semester.

**Undergraduates**: please contact me for possible projects. Students from biology, computer science, and other sciences may find good fits
