title: Connecting other health conditions to cancer 
summary: Diabetes, obesity, and immunodeficiency are just a few of the health conditions that can impact cancer. Using genomic data, we can learn about disease mechanisms contributing to cancer.

Cancer develops through successive genotypic and microenvironmental changes to neoplastic tissue. Even for patients with the same tumor type, the life history events contributing to oncogenesis can vary. In this project we combine genetic, genomic, and epidemiological methods to study disease phenotypes contributing to cancer incidence, such as chronic inflammation or metabolic pathologies. Our findings will illuminate tumor biology and suggest personalized therapies.

Common genetic variation can alter biological processes in subtle ways that eventually lead to disease development. Resources like the UK biobank combine genetic information with data on the corresponding health states of the same people. By combining multiple types of genomic data we examine how common disease processes may impact cancer development
